# Xircuits PyCaret Components Library


This library consists of PyCaret components that allow to implements of the different AutoML tasks in Xircuits:

1. Classification
2. Regression 
3. Anomaly Detection 
4. Clustering 
5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

We have supported this library with multiple Xircuits implantations for most of the AutoML tasks, these can be found in the `examples/` folder.

Below is a simple illustration of the basic AutoML implementation using Pycaret components library in Xircuits:  

## Classification 
### AutoMLBasicBinaryClassification.xircuits

This example allows to build a basic Pycaret classification application that reads a tabular dataset, setup the environment, compare training on multiple ML models, fine-tune models, plot results and save the trained model.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

### AutoMLBasicNLP.xircuit

This example allows to build a basic Pycaret NLP application that reads a tabular dataset, setup the environment, Create and assign NLP ML models, plot results and save the trained model.
